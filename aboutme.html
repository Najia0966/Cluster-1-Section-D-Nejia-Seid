                    <p>My name is NAJIA SEID i was born in 2000 GC in Ethiopia specifically <br>
                        in Addis Ababa lafto sub city.am a 3rd child I have<br>
                    2 brothers and one sister. I live with my parents. I was very active,<br>
                     curious and communicative child. I would ask dozen<br>
                    of questions each minute even without waiting for the answers.<br>
                    My thirst for knowledge did not come to an end when I was at school. <br>
                    I was passionate about science and psychology .This<br>
                    help me to understand and know about people and what they thing.<br>
                     I am an engineering student at Addis Ababa university<br>
                    EIABC campus. Am certain that my degree will become my ticket to a better tomorrow.
                    <br>
                    Of course, I understand that life is not just a bed of rose, <br>
                    and challenges and hardships are an integral element of<br>
                    life. But with the help of Allah everything will pass Inshallah.<br>
